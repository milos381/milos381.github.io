Long time ago, when I was opening my first small business, I wasn't aware how digital world works. I did not know anything about digital marketing, google ads or even how to use online tools to create a website. 

I hired a guy, a professional, to build me a website. After a whole month of waiting, he called me and sent me a finished website. I was really dissapointed.
The website looked okay, not great, not terrible, just okay. There wasn't any complicated parts, no online payments, it was just a presentational website for my small business. So, after a month of waiting and 1250$ payed to him, I've got a website that just didn't reflect what my business was about. 
After couple of months, I closed that business and opened a new one, but now I didn't want to hire someone to build me a website, I wanted to do it on my own, and there were two reasons for that:

1. I knew I could do it better and cheaper than that guy;
2. I could actually build something that reflects what my business is all about;

So, I bought few Udemy courses and started to study. I had a lot of dead-ends with javascript, due to the fact that I had no mentor, there was a lot of illogical rules, a lot of times I would spend more time on stack-owerflow than in my code editor, but not long time after, I've built my first website. 
Of course, I've redesigned it few times before I published it, but at the end, I've built something that I actually like.
That is when I decided to, when time comes, I want to study that, in a proper school, with a menthor who helps me when I get stuck.
One year forward, here I am. My first blog, few days before my Day 1 in Flatiron school and a dream of me being a software developer one year from now.
