On my day one, I wasn't sure where should I start. On one hand, since I do have some front-end experience, Scraping was an easier choice compared to getting data from an API, but on the other hand, this school is not meant to just be finished, but to actually learn something, so I chose API.

Finding a right API was no joke. Even if there is a plethora of APIs on the web, I couldn't find an API that I like that easily. Most of them required upgrading to PRO, which would mean paying for their API key, and the ones who didn't, their explanation of endpoint documentation wasn't so clear. 

So, I guess this is what happens when you choose a project before you choose an API.

Once I chose my API and started coding, things just started to "fit in". Of course I had to google a lot in order to finish what I've started, but eventually my CLI did what I wanted it to do: do the currency exchange.

At the beggining, the user can choose if he wants to see the currency exchange rate or directly proceed to do the transaction. If he chooses to see the rates first, right after he gets the return information, he can choose if he wants to proceed further with the transaction or to exit the CLI.

I did try implementing custom errors, but I was told that they are not necessary, so I left that for when I have more time to commit to this project.

I am really happy my CLI works. It was a hard way getting from zero to here. Hopefully, I'll feel the same excitement with my next project as I did with this one.
