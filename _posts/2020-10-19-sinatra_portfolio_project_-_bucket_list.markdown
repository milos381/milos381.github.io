Sinatra Project, or a step two of Software Engenereeng program, was a great step forward for us beginners, which helped us to understand how a framework works, how can we implement basic security protocols, connect users, implement sessions, navigate through pages and understand how the big websites, such as AirBnB or Twitter work.

In this project, we imlemented the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) standard database commands, which represent the base of this project.

The idea for my project (Bucket List) came from the last few labs, and basically allows any user to post their bucket list wishes publicly, so every other user can see it. On the other hand, only the user who posted it can actually edit or delete it's own bucket list wish.

Helper methods are also implemented in this project, which help us to determine who is the current user and is it logged in.

Our two models (User and Item) are connected through relationships has_many and belong_to.

This project represent a crown of our knowledge of everything we learned until now regarding Sinatra.
