Here we are at the end of the Flatiron road. 

In the final project we were required to implement all the knowledge we acquired over the last few months.

My final project is basically an upgrade of a phone store project that I did few months back. I tried to make it look like an apple store, with the tabs above the main window, apple logo in the background and of coure, iphones and ipads for sale.

In this app, we are able to create and delete desired items, that would be listed on the webpage after `fetch` would do it's job. Once the list is visible, we can access every single item individually to see more details. In my case, we can see the price, but the app is editable, so more information can be inserted.

How we are able to manage our items?

By defining reducers, after passing them tokens, we can see the magic works. The actions in the React are resposible for working with `fetch`. We can add or delete any item we wish to. We can also add many more items that can be managed as well, such as apple watch or air tags. 

I am really happy to see my amateur apple store up and running without any issues!
